AES)
- AES Galois counter mode
- What makes a block cipher good? What metrics?
- If I were to start from first principals how would I arrive at AES?
  - i.e. why is there all this rigormoral?
  - Why do we need 10 rounds of all this shit?

- Fix padding on challange 14
- Doc attack + analysis form above qs
- Go back over and re fac set 3 into AES + doc
